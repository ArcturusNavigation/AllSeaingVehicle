## Conventions

* If task world contains a lot of models of the same type. They should have number in name. Gazebo doesn't like non-unique names.
* In task world ASV always starts on coordinates [0,0] with unknown rotation, so task should be realive to drone. Distanced away from ASV as defined in Handbook.
* World name could contain parameters of given variation.

## Naming scheme

- gen – if file has been generated by a script and can be overwritten
- manual – if file has been edited by a user, source could be generated from gazebo or script

### Single tasks

`task{number}-{manual,gen}[-var{variation_id}]`

### Courses or multiple tasks

`course-{manual,gen}[-var{variation_id}]`
